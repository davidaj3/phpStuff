            <h1>David A. Jones</h1>
            <p>I am a senior studying music composition at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  I am from Lacey, Washington.
                Music has always been an invaluable part of my life--in many ways it defines who I am.  I began playing
                music as early as age 8.  My primary instrument is the French horn, though I played trumpet alongside the
                horn in high school, and I've dabbled in various percussion instruments.  Inspired by the repertoire we
                performed in my high school's band program, I began composing my own works for band during my junior year,
                and I've been composing music for a variety of ensembles ever since.  I served my mission in Manila, in the
                Philippines, and developed a great love for the people, the culture, and the language there.  Following my
                graduation here at BYU-I, I plan to go on to study composition at the graduate level and earn my Master's
                and Doctorate in composition.  Ultimately, I hope to teach music theory and composition
                at the college level while establishing my own career in composition.
